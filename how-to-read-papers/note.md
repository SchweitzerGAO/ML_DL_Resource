a 3-pass approach to reading a paper

**pass 1**

Skimming:

title->abstract->conclusion: *what is this?*

a glance at tables and graph/diagrams

**pass 2**

Scanning: clarify the methods; mark the unfamiliar papers(read them if this paper is difficult)

**pass 3**

carefully read all of the sentences of the paper. Make sure that I understand all the sentences and the intention of this. Imagine if I were the author how I would do that.
